This organization builds Python containers that support multiple architectures. While most python packages support speedy installs with prebuilt wheels, many do not yet build wheels for ARM based architectures- and even fewer are built with musl libc, the C Library used in Alpine. This leaves developers on those systems faced with a choice- use a potentially buggy emulation layer for their containers or wait 20+ minutes while their containers compile those packages. The containers in this organization provide another option.


<h3 align="center">Multi Architecture Builds</h3>

All containers in this organization support `amd64` and `arm64`, and most of them also support `arm v7`.


<h3 align="center">Small Images via Multi Stage Builds</h3>

All libraries are compiled in one image before being moved into the final published image. This keeps all of the build tools out of the published container layers.


<h3 align="center">No Rate Limits</h3>

This project uses the Github Container Registry to store images, which have no rate limiting on pulls (unlike Docker Hub).


<h3 align="center">Rapid Building of New Versions</h3>

Within 30 minutes of a new release to the upstream project on PyPI builds will kick off for new containers. This means new versions can be used in hours, not days.

<h3 align="center">Regular Updates</h3>

Containers are rebuilt weekly in order to take on the security patches from upstream containers.
